# Project Title

EDA on credit score classification

## Languages and Tools:
 numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn

## Problem Statement:
The project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase to gain insights into the dataset. Following the EDA, the data cleaning process involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any inconsistencies or errors in the dataset. Additionally, data transformation techniques were employed to prepare the data for modeling, including feature scaling and encoding categorical variables.
